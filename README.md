- "Today's programming wisdom is to write code that is clear and easy to understand, rather than overly complex and difficult to maintain. This means using descriptive variable names, writing concise and well-structured functions, and commenting your code thoroughly. Remember, code is read more often than it is written, so make sure it's readable and understandable for yourself and others who may need to work on it in the future."
